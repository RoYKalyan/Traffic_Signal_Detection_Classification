Traffic Sign Recognition for Autonomous Vehicles

Deep learning and automotive advancements are driving the development of smart cars and autonomous vehicles. Traffic sign recognition, essential for safe autonomous driving, is being tackled with innovative deep-learning techniques. These signs are paramount for global traffic flow and driver safety. Recognizing them improves driver assistance systems and the driving experience in general. While challenges like weather variations and sign degradation exist, Smart Driving Support Systems offer promising solutions for both Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems and future autonomous vehicles.

Our research introduces two novel CNN architectures, namely the TS-Net and TSDetector CNN models, trained on the 'German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark' (GTSDB) dataset. The goal is to improve traffic sign detection and classification accuracy and contribute to the progression of autonomous vehicle technology, ultimately mitigating traffic accidents.

In the object detection task, our custom TSDetector model outperformed both FasterRCNN and RetinaNet. For classification, the pre-trained ResNet50 model achieved the highest accuracy, surpassing MobileNetV2 and the custom TS-Net. Our aspiration is for these models to surpass traditional methods, thereby further unlocking the potential of custom deep-learning architectures for real-world autonomous driving applications.
